# SwarmForm

SwarmForm is a distributed workflow management system for High Performance Computing environments. SwarmForm introduces task clustering to reduce the makespan of workflows executed using it by minimizing the overheads. SwarmForm follows a distributed architecture with independent programs controlling different functional layers in workflow management.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you familiar with the installation and basic functions of the SwarmForm.

### Prerequisites

pip install swarmform
```

### Basic usage

Following is a step by step series of examples that tell you how to use the basic system functions.

Initialize a SwarmForm launchpad YAML file
```
sform init
```

Insert a SwarmFlow from file
```
sform add -sf <file path>
```

Get SwarmFlow from SwarmPad
```
sform get_sf -id <SwarmFlow ID>
```

Cluster the fireworks in the SwarmFlow and save the new SwarmFlow to the database
```
sform cluster -sf <SwarmFlow ID>
```

Reset and re-initialize the SwarmForm database
```
sform reset
```

Launch a single rocket to execute a firework
```
rlaunch singleshot
```

Launch a multiple rockets sequentially to execute all the fireworks
```
rlaunch rapidfire
```

Launch parallel m nummber of rockets to execute all the fireworks parallely.(Usually m equals to number of available resources) 
```
mlaunch <m>
```
